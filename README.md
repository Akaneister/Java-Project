Inventory Management Application

Description

    The Inventory Management Application is a Java application designed to assist store owners in managing their inventory efficiently. This project aims to provide essential inventory management functionalities without relying on external frameworks. The application allows users to add, view, update, delete, and search inventory items based on various criteria.

Application Features:

    Adding Inventory Items:

        Users can add new inventory items with basic information such as name, category, price, and quantity.

    Viewing Inventory:

        The application displays all inventory items with their basic information.
        Inventory items can be sorted based on criteria like name, category, price, and availability.
        Updating Inventory Items:
        Users have the ability to update existing inventory item details, such as changing the price or adding quantity.
        Deleting Inventory Items:
        Inventory items can be deleted from the list as needed.
        Searching Inventory:
        Users can search for inventory items based on various criteria, including name, category, and price.
        The application utilizes a text file named "inventory.txt" to store data, and if this file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

Technical Requirements:

    The Inventory Management Application is developed solely in Java without using external frameworks. It employs fundamental Java concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, and lists. Data is stored locally either in the application's memory or in text files. Additionally, the application implements a command-line interface for user interaction. Care has been taken to ensure that the application is well-structured, readable, and adequately commented to enhance understanding.

    This project provides students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge of Java programming and basic object-oriented programming concepts. It also allows them to practice developing applications independently without relying on external frameworks, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of fundamental software development principles.

Usage : 

        Running the Application:

        Execute the Main class to start the application.
        The console interface will open, presenting a menu of options for managing the inventory.

        Adding Inventory Items:

        Select option 1 from the menu to add a new inventory item.
        Follow the prompts to enter the name, category, price, and quantity of the item.
        If the category doesn't exist, it will be automatically created.

        Viewing Inventory:

        Select option 2 from the menu to view all inventory items.
        The application will display a list of all inventory items, including their basic information such as name, price, and quantity.
        Inventory items can be sorted based on criteria like name, category, price, and availability.

        Updating Inventory Items:

        Select option 3 from the menu to update an existing inventory item.
        Enter the name of the item you want to update, then follow the prompts to enter the new details (name, category, price, quantity).

        Deleting Inventory Items:

        Select option 4 from the menu to delete an existing inventory item.
        Enter the name of the item you want to delete, and it will be removed from the inventory.

        Searching Inventory:

        Select option 5 from the menu to search for inventory items based on various criteria.
        Choose the search criteria (name, category, price range, availability) and provide the necessary input.
        The application will display the search results matching the specified criteria.

        Data Storage:

        The application utilizes a text file named "inventory.txt" to store inventory data.
        If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
        The data is stored locally in the text file and can be loaded into memory when the application starts.

        Exiting the Application:
        
        Select option 6 from the menu to exit the application.
        This will terminate the program and return you to the command line.
